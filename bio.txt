I don't know what to do king

> I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Waterloo, is in fact, Kitchener/Waterloo, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Kitchener plus Waterloo. Waterloo is not a metropolitan area unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning Kitchener system made useful by the Kitchener transit lines, municipal utilities and vital urban components comprising a full metropolitan region as defined by Statistics Canada.

> Many residents live in a modified version of the Kitchener system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Kitchener which is widely used today is often called Waterloo, and many of its residents are not aware that it is basically the Kitchener system, developed by the City of Kitchener.

> There really is a Waterloo, and these people are living in it, but it is just a part of the region they inhabit. Waterloo is the university town: the area in the system that allocates the region's tech resources to the other municipalities that you visit. The university town is an essential part of a metropolitan region, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete urban system. Waterloo is normally used in combination with the Kitchener metropolitan system: the whole region is basically Kitchener with Waterloo added, or Kitchener/Waterloo. All the so-called Waterloo developments are really developments of Kitchener/Waterloo!
