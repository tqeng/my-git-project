Policy 71 – Student Discipline
Established:

6 June 1989

Last updated:

1 May 2019

 

28 February 2020. Amended, official titles only.

Class:

G

1.   INTRODUCTION
This policy applies to University of Waterloo (University or UW) students, including individuals who were students at the time of the event(s) upon which a disciplinary proceeding is based.

A discipline decision of an academic support unit (e.g. athletics, library, parking, on-campus pubs and student residences) is handled under the unit’s internal mechanism and not under this policy unless the matter is referred to an associate dean. 

Resources to advise students include the Conflict Management and Human Rights Office, Student Resource Office, Secretariat and faculty undergraduate and graduate offices. Resources to assist students include Counselling Services, Health Services, and AccessAbility Services.

Authority to deal with matters under this policy rests with the undergraduate and graduate associate deans. In cases where criminal proceedings have been initiated against a student, the authority usually vested in an associate dean rests with the Vice-President, Academic & Provost, who will keep the associate dean of the student’s home faculty informed. A decision of the Vice-President, Academic & Provost is appealable to the University Committee on Student Appeals but remains in effect during the appeal process.

Matters pertaining to courses offered by and events occurring on the property of:

Conrad Grebel University College – Academic discipline is handled under this Policy. Non-academic discipline is handled under this Policy, except that, if the student involved has signed a contract with the college, then the discipline is handled under the terms of the contract and/or Grebel Residents Handbook.
Renison University College – Academic discipline is handled under this Policy.  Non-academic discipline is dealt with under this Policy, except for residence matters, which are handled under residence procedures.
St. Paul’s University College - Academic discipline is handled under this Policy. Non-academic discipline is dealt with under this Policy except for residence matters, which are handled under residence procedures.
St. Jerome’s University - Discipline is handled under policies and procedures established by St. Jerome’s.
The associate dean (undergraduate or graduate) of a student’s home faculty is the locus for student discipline records. When a student is known to have changed faculties, the student’s discipline record is to be forwarded to the associate dean of the new home faculty. 

Behaviour which unduly interferes with the study, work or working environment of other members of the University or any aspect of another's University activity is dealt with under Policy 33 - Ethical Behaviour.

 2.   PRINCIPLES
a.   Academic
Communication, inquiry and the free exchange of ideas are fundamental to a university education, and require an environment of tolerance and respect. Academic freedom provides for the freedom to study, learn, publish and debate, independent of current opinion, subject to commonly accepted scholarly standards. Academic freedom is protected and carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a responsible and ethical way. A student's academic freedom does not extend to disruption of other students, faculty or staff members, or their work/study/residence environments.

Academic integrity is a commitment to five basic values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. It applies to all academic endeavours – teaching, learning and scholarship, and applies to a range of academic activities, from conduct in research to the writing of co-op work term reports.

Students are expected to know what constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing offences, and to take responsibility for their actions.

Students are responsible for demonstrating behaviour that is honest and ethical in their academic work. Such behaviour includes:

Abiding by University policies and provincial and federal legislation.
Following the expectations articulated by instructors for referencing sources of information and for group work.
Submitting original work, citing sources fully, and respecting the authorship of others.
Preventing their work from being used by others, e.g. not lending assignments to others, protecting access to computer files.
Asking for clarification of expectations as necessary. Students who are in any doubt as to whether an action on their part may be viewed as a violation of the standards of academic integrity should ask their instructors, lab assistants and/or advisors.
Adhering to the principles of academic integrity when conducting and reporting research.
b. Non-academic
Students are individually responsible for their actions whether acting alone or in a group. Students have an obligation to make responsible decisions concerning their conduct. Appropriate behaviour includes:

Respecting the rights and property of others.
Allowing for the peaceful and safe enjoyment of the University campus and facilities.
Abiding by University policies, municipal bylaws, and provincial and federal legislation.
c. Procedural Fairness
The procedures for handling offences reflect the gravity with which the University views such offences. At the same time, these procedures represent the University’s commitment to fairness.

Fairness is fundamental when dealing with students. Students have the right to be informed of policies, procedures or guidelines that may affect their academic progress or their conduct, and have the right to question whether decisions are consistent with those policies, procedures or guidelines.

Each student is entitled to:

a presumption of innocence unless the contrary is established;
be made aware of the case against him/her;
have matters addressed fairly and expeditiously;
be accompanied by a support person to any meeting with administrators and to any hearing;
have matters heard by those who are not sitting in judgment of their own actions or decisions;
know, respond to and seek clarification of evidence presented by witnesses; and
decisions based on the balance of probabilities with consideration given to consistency and University precedent.
3.   OFFENCES
Student misconduct relating to activities of any type under University auspices, other than that falling under Policy 33 - Ethical Behaviour, is covered by this policy.

Any member of the University who has reason to believe that an academic offence has been committed by a student has a responsibility to report the matter promptly to the instructor of the course or to the associate dean of the faculty sponsoring the activity. A teaching assistant shall report to both the instructor and the appropriate associate dean of the faculty sponsoring the academic activity. The associate dean will investigate and render a decision or refer the matter to the appropriate authority.

Any member of the University who has reason to believe that a non-academic offence has been committed by a student has a responsibility to report the matter promptly to the associate dean of the student’s home faculty or to UW Police who will advise the associate dean. The associate dean will investigate and render a decision or refer the matter to the appropriate authority. In cases involving disruptive or threatening behaviour on the part of students (including assault, vandalism, theft and similar behaviour), UW Police shall be contacted to establish order. Individuals should not attempt to resolve a dangerous situation. In all such cases the matter shall be reported to the associate dean by UW Police.

No degree, diploma or certificate shall be awarded, nor shall a student be allowed to withdraw from a course in which an offence is alleged to have been committed, from the time an alleged offence is reported until the final disposition of the matter.

Offences listed below are intended to be interpreted broadly. The list is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather illustrative of the typical categories of academic and non-academic offences. Misconduct includes causing an event to occur, either by omission or commission. Any act that violates the principles of this policy or that falls below a standard acceptable in the University community is subject to discipline, as is an attempt to commit or assisting someone to commit any such act.

Offences include, but are not limited to, the following:

ACADEMIC

NON-ACADEMIC

cheating
plagiarism
unauthorized co-operation or collaboration as defined by the course instructor
unauthorized aids or assistance as defined by the course instructor
unauthorized resubmission of work
violation of examination regulations
impersonating another student or entering into an arrangement with another to be impersonated
obtaining, distributing, or receiving any confidential academic material without the express consent of the instructor
theft of intellectual property
academic or admission fraud discovered after registration
altering, falsifying or withholding a relevant document
misrepresentation
obstruction or interference
misconduct in research including breach of ethics regarding human or animal testing
contravention of statute (e.g., Copyright Act)
disruptive, dangerous, aggressive or threatening behaviour, including by electronic means
misuse of University resources, equipment or supplies, including, but not limited to, computers and network, keys, records, permits, letterhead
mischief
vandalism
theft
infringing unreasonably on the work of others
violation of instructor’s communicated rules, such as prohibition of recording lecture
violation of safety regulations in a laboratory or other setting
unauthorized use of equipment, material or a facility or service
unethical behaviour
contravention of statute (e.g., Liquor License Act; Criminal Code)
Procedure
See Appendix A - Academic Discipline Procedure

See Appendix B - Non-academic Discipline Procedure

4. PENALTIES
At the conclusion of an investigation where misconduct has been found, the student will be given at a minimum a letter of reprimand. Other penalties may be imposed as the situation warrants. University departments (e.g. Co-operative Education, Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs Office, UW Police) shall be sent a copy of the decision as appropriate. A copy of a decision will be placed in the student’s discipline record by the associate dean of the home faculty.

Penalties (other than removal of privileges and expulsion) are normally not in force while an appeal is being decided. In exceptional circumstances (such as when the continued presence of the student would unduly affect scholarly activities), on a case-by-case basis and after consultation (e.g. with the associate dean, UW Police), the chair of the University Committee on Student Appeals (UCSA) may order that a penalty be enforced while an appeal is in process. Such a decision of the UCSA chair is final.

A student may not graduate while under suspension, nor will the University verify that degree requirements have been met until the end of the suspension.

One or more of the following penalties may be imposed:

                          ACADEMIC                                           

NON-ACADEMIC

letter of reprimand
disciplinary probation
grade penalty on an assignment, test, examination, or course; or, where applicable, failed standing in a term or modification of final grade
failed work term
extra academic work
removal of privileges
additional course(s), possibly taken as Degree Requirement, Not in Average
community service
suspension
expulsion
revocation of degree, diploma, certificate, standing or credit
letter of reprimand
disciplinary probation
restitution
community service
fine
eviction from UW student residence / housing
ban from a University facility or sponsored event, or from the campus
removal of privileges
suspension
expulsion
– such other remedial or disciplinary action or order as appropriate in the circumstances –
Factors to be considered when imposing academic penalties
The circumstances surrounding each case of academic misconduct may vary to a significant degree. The penalty imposed should reflect these circumstances. The Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties are not intended to restrict the authority or flexibility of associate deans in imposing penalties. In each case the associate dean shall exercise his/her discretion, taking into consideration the relevant factors as outlined below. For the benefit of the student the associate dean shall provide an explanation in the written decision of the major reasons(s) the penalty imposed was deemed warranted.

Factors to be considered by associate deans when imposing a penalty include, but are not limited to:

The severity of the offence, including its impact on others (UW students, faculty or staff; other students, members of the community)
Relative weight of the assignment
The level of the student’s academic experience
Whether the student admits guilt, accepts responsibility for his/her action and is amenable to educative remedies
Extenuating circumstances that may help explain the action taken by a student
Any aggravating factors
Any record of previous offences
For graduate students, whether the work in which the offence has been committed is one of the major milestones of the graduate program
See Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties

See  Framework for the Assessment of Undergraduate Plagiarism

See Framework for the Assessment of Unauthorized Collaboration Involving Undergraduate Students

 5. REPORTING
At the conclusion of an investigation the person investigating will advise the student in writing of the determination. Normally the person who reported the incident will be advised that the matter has been dealt with.

A report on any discipline action taken is to be filed in the Secretariat by the associate dean. A summary of cases is to be posted to the Secretariat website annually.

The University Committee on Student Appeals will report cases annually to Senate.

Information related to a discipline decision will be retained in compliance with the University's records retention schedule.

6. APPEAL
A discipline decision is appealable under Policy 72 - Student Appeals provided that a ground for appeal can be established.

A decision of the Vice-President, Academic & Provost (or delegate) is appealable under Policy 72 - Student Appeals provided that a ground for appeal can be established.

Deadline: An appeal must be started by delivering aNotice of Appeal Form (72A) (Word doc) within 10 days of notification of the decision. See Policy 72 - Student Appeals.

FORMS
for use by associate dean to report a decision:

Summary of Disciplinary Action Taken Form (71A) (Word doc)

Appendix A - Academic Discipline Procedure
It is expected that an associate dean will render a decision within 50 working days from the reporting of the offence to him/her. If this timeline will not be met, the associate dean will advise the student in writing and provide a revised timeline.

Examinations are a special situation. Procedures to be followed when misconduct is suspected are set out in the memorandum “Proctoring of Mid-Term Tests and Final Examinations: When Cheating is Suspected; Authority to Search for and/or Confiscate Unauthorized Aids Proctor Instructions”.

1. a) Allegation
A member of the University other than the course instructor who has reason to believe that an academic offence has been committed shall report the matter to the instructor of the course or the appropriate associate dean of the faculty sponsoring the academic activity within 5 working days of detection. A teaching assistant shall report to both the instructor and the appropriate associate dean of the faculty sponsoring the academic activity.

1. b) Informal resolution by instructor
If an instructor who discovers or is made aware of an apparent academic offence in a course he/she is teaching wishes to attempt to resolve the offence informally with the student, he/she shall begin the process within 10 working days of detection or notification of the offence. The proposed resolution may not have a penalty that exceeds a reduction in course grade and disciplinary probation.

The allegation, admission of guilt and proposed resolution shall be submitted by the instructor to the associate dean of the faculty sponsoring the academic activity and the student so informed. If the alleged offender is registered in a different faculty, the associate dean who receives the report shall inform the associate dean of the student’s home faculty of the allegation; together they shall decide which of them will handle the matter and keep the other informed.

The associate dean may instruct the Registrar’s/Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs Office to insert a UR notation (under review) for the course in the student’s academic record. No application for withdrawal from the course will be processed pending the outcome of the investigation. If an allegation is made after a student has withdrawn from a course, the withdrawal shall be void, the student re-enrolled in the course and a UR recorded. A UR remains until the matter is dealt with and the appeal period has expired. A student cannot graduate with a UR on his/her record.

Any evidence gathered shall be retained by the instructor in case it is required, but need not be submitted initially unless requested by the associate dean. The associate dean will check the student’s discipline record and determine whether the proposed resolution is appropriate. If the proposed resolution is approved by the associate dean, he/she will advise the instructor and student in writing. The associate dean shall file a copy of the informal resolution in the Secretariat and in the student’s discipline record.

If the proposed resolution is not approved by the associate dean, he/she will advise the instructor and student in writing that the matter will proceed as if the informal resolution had not taken place. The instructor will then submit any evidence collected to the associate dean, the student’s admission of guilt will be void and the matter will proceed under 1.c) below.

1. c) Allegation reported to Associate Dean
On notification of an alleged offence in a course the associate dean may instruct the Registrar’s/Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs Office to insert a UR notation (under review) for the course in the student’s academic record. No application for withdrawal from the course will be processed pending the outcome of the investigation. If an allegation is made after a student has withdrawn from a course, the withdrawal shall be void, the student re-enrolled in the course and a UR recorded. A UR remains until the matter is dealt with and the appeal period has expired. A student cannot graduate with a UR on his/her record.

If the alleged offender is registered in a different faculty, the associate dean who receives the report shall inform the associate dean of the student’s home faculty of the allegation; together they shall decide which of them will handle the matter and keep the other informed.

Upon receipt of an allegation that an offence has been committed, the associate dean shall decide whether an attempt should be made to resolve the matter informally. If so, the associate dean may encourage the faculty member and student to attempt a resolution under 1.b) above or may attempt to reach an informal resolution through direct discussion with the student. If a resolution is reached directly with the student, the associate dean shall file a copy of the informal resolution in the Secretariat and in the student’s discipline record.

If informal resolution is not attempted or is not successful, the associate dean will proceed with a formal inquiry under step 2.

2. Formal Inquiry
The associate dean shall inform the student in writing of the allegation and the links to the applicable policy and case summaries. The student shall have5 working daysto respond in writing. If either party requests a meeting, one shall be arranged.

After receipt of the student’s response or after the time for a response has passed the associate dean shall conduct a thorough investigation of the allegation. To assist in the investigation the associate dean may consult with people such as experts in the student’s discipline, another associate dean, and UW Police. If the associate dean needs more information or response to specific questions from the student, this can be done either by a meeting, by telephone, or by email.

If the student fails to respond to any communication from the associate dean or fails to attend a scheduled meeting, the associate dean may proceed without input from the student.

When the investigation is complete the associate dean will provide the student with his/her written findings and decision. If either party requests a meeting, one shall be arranged. A copy of the decision shall be provided on a need-to-know basis to administrative units (e.g. Co-operative Education, Registrar, UW Police) and will be filed in the Secretariat and in the student’s discipline record.

3. Appeal
A formal inquiry decision of an associate dean can be appealed following the procedure set out in Policy 72 - Student Appeals provided that a ground for appeal can be established. A student must deliver a
Notice of Appeal Form (72A) (Word doc)  within 10 working days of notification of the decision. See Policy 72 - Student Appeals.

Appendix C - Guidelines When Criminal Proceedings have been Initiated Against a Student
When UW is made aware that criminal proceedings have been initiated against a student and the student’s activity impacts or may impact campus safety, decisions with respect to student discipline shall be made by the Vice-President, Academic & Provost (or delegate).

A group shall be convened as soon as possible to advise the Vice-President, Academic & Provost (or delegate) and would likely include the following representatives: UW Police, legal advisors, associate dean (as appropriate), Health Services, and Counselling Services. Others whose advice may be sought, as the situation warrants, include Co-operative and Experiential Education and AccessAbility Services.

If a determination is made that the student’s presence on campus would pose a risk/potential risk, a letter will be issued by the Vice-President, Academic & Provost (or delegate) to the student indicating that the student is banned from UW property until further notice. The letter will be hand delivered by UW Police to either the student’s legal counsel or to the court and copied to all those on campus who manage the student information for the student in question (e.g., associate dean(s), department/program chair(s), Co-operative and Experiential Education, Counselling Services, Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs, Health Services, Housing and Residences, Registrar's Office). A record of the ban will be recorded in the student information system. At a time when a ban may be removed, the same parties with a need to know will be notified.

The letter will advise the student what UW requires of the student so that UW can continue in its assessment/decision-making in the case (e.g., consulting psychiatrist report from an off-campus professional, etc.) and also makes clear under what circumstances the student may enter UW property (e.g., may be allowed on campus through pre-arranged visits and checking in with UW Police on arrival).

UW Police will attend at any show cause hearing to ask the court that conditions of release include that the student shall not enter UW property without having prior written permission from the Vice-President, Academic & Provost (or delegate) and that upon entering UW property the student shall immediately attend at the UW Police office, present the written permission and follow the instructions provided by that office. UW Police will communicate the terms and conditions of release to those on campus with need to know. 

Following receipt and review of the requested reports and taking into account other information as required, the Vice-President, Academic & Provost (or delegate) will determine next steps and communicate these to the student as well as others with a need to know.

The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the Office of Indigenous Relations.
